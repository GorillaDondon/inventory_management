# inventory_management
<h2>Scenario</h2>  
We are a small business trying to manage our inventory. It’s hard for us to identify our current stock at a glance. We need a solution that can help us keep track of inventory going out and coming in. Since we are a small team we’d like the inventory tracking to be automated.  

<h2>Solution Structure</h2>  
<h4>Item Master</h4>  
- Data source for items available for sale and purchase<br>    
- Display orders that include the item<br>       

<h4>Contact Master</h4>
•	Data source for customers and vendors<br>
•	Create views to show customers and vendors separately<br>
•	Display orders for the contact<br>

<h4>Orders Tracking</h4>
•	App to track sales and purchases<br>
•	Create a process management workflow to track the status of an order<br>
•	JavaScript customization needed to automate inventory management<br>
    - Push your code to a GitHub repository

<h2>Notes</h2>
•	Utilize Kintone event handlers to trigger the customization<br>
•	Utilize JSEdit to help speed up development<br>
•	Keep the end user experience in mind while designing your Kintone apps<br>
•	Please use the supplied Kintone App pack to create a basic solution structure<br>
    o	No record data is sent with the Kintone App pack
•	Create your own record data or use a tool such as https://mockaroo.com/<br>
